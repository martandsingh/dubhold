# Help
#### There are three files:
##### customers.csv - which is being used for databricks assessment. I am uploading customers.csv to DBFS location (explained in notebook), as there was a choice given to use either SQL or CSV file.

##### spark-assessment_final.ipynb - this is a python jupyter notebook for databricks assessment. 

##### sql-assessment_final_sub.sql - this if SQL script.

## Notes:
#### 1. As I am using databricks environment to run my spark notebook, I am using display() method to show formated dataset, if you are using an environment other than databricks in that case display() method can show error.

#### 2. In sql assessment the employee table used in two different case studies (2nd & 3rd). So before starting 3rd case study, I am dropping the employees table created before, as they both have different schema.
